We carry out the thoughtful investigations on the end-to-end delay comparison based on several proposed low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, i.e., GlobalStar, Iridium, TeleSat, Kuiper, StarLink, OneWeb with 720 and 1764 satellite nodes. Analysis of delay performance changes in communication between international cities and domestic cities under different constellation structures.
